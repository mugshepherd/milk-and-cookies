# WDI Portfolio Standup

##When: Thursday, May 28th 1:30-4:30pm##

The Portfolio Standup is an opportunity for you to get first hand experience sharing your portfolio for the first time and learning from industry mentors. You should push to discover what hiring managers are looking for in candidates' portfolios. 

You are **not** expected to have completed portfolio pieces. Your reviewer knows that you have not graduated and your portfolio is in draft form. This is an opportunity for you to improve your portfolio and prepare for your job search after the class ends.

The format that has been suggested to the reviewers is as follows:

**Open discussion (10 min)**

- What is it like to work at your company for developers?
- What types of candidates are you looking for? How can they put their best foot forward?
- What is the interview process like at your company? 
- What are you looking for in candidates' portfolio? 

**Open sharing session (40 min)** 

- Students will share their portfolio/work with the room


**Hiring Manager “Ask Me Anything” (10 min)**
