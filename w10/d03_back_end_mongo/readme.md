- [A GinkoApp](https://gingkoapp.com/pr0d27)


## Learning Objectives

- Compare and contrast relational to document based (NoSql)
- Setup local mongo db server
- CRUD documents using mongo CLI
- Use an ORM to persist data (Mongoose)
- Connect ORM to an Express app, to persist data



## Opening

> MongoDB is an open-source **document database** that provides:
- High Performance
- High Availability
- Automatic Scaling

## Document Database?

### A basic sample:

``` json
{
  name: "Sue",
  age: 26,
  status: "Active",
  groups: ["sass", "express"]
}
```
---
TPS: What do you see? 

### A Document

- json
- different data types
- even arrays

### More complicated sample:

``` json
{
   "_id" : ObjectId("54c955492b7c8eb21818bd09"),
   "address" : {
      "street" : "2 Avenue",
      "zipcode" : "10075",
      "building" : "1480",
      "coord" : [ -73.9557413, 40.7720266 ],
   },
   "borough" : "Manhattan",
   "cuisine" : "Italian",
   "grades" : [
      {
         "date" : ISODate("2014-10-01T00:00:00Z"),
         "grade" : "A",
         "score" : 11
      },
      {
         "date" : ISODate("2014-01-16T00:00:00Z"),
         "grade" : "B",
         "score" : 17
      }
   ],
   "name" : "Vella",
   "restaurant_id" : "41704620"
}
```

## Documents

### A record in MongoDB is a document

- a data structure composed of field(key) and value pairs.
  - similar to JSON objects.
  - stored as BJSON
- fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

## Collections

MongoDB stores documents in collections.

- Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.
- does **NOT** require its documents to have the same schema.
- documents stored in a collection must have a unique `_id` field that acts as a primary key.

## [Installation](https://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

### Install

```
brew update
brew install mongo
```

You should see:
```
mongodb: stable 3.0.3 (bottled), devel 3.1.2
```

### Start mongo:

```
mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
```

You should see:

`nothing`
> no news is good news



### More info?

```
brew info mongo
```

## Mongo shell

### Start the shell

```
$ mongo
```

You should see:

```
MongoDB shell version: 3.0.3
connecting to: test
>
```

### Help

```
help
```

ThinkShare (2min): 
- What jumps out as important?
- Try it

## What jumped out to me
- `show dbs`: show database names
- `show collections`:  show collections in current database
- `use <db_name>`: set current database
- `db.foo.find()`: list objects in collection foo


- `it`: result of the last line evaluated; use to further iterate
  - ??? Not sure, but sounds like a helpful shortcut for future

Also:

- `<tab>` key completion
- `<up-arrow>` and the `<down-arrow>` for history.



## Milk-n-Cookies.  Yum!

Let's keep track of where we can get some yummy Milk and Cookies.

# Where are we?

Remember back to that first day?

- Start from what we know
- Where you are **really** matters
- Small steps

We *want* to work with the `milk-n-cookies` database:

```
use milk-n-cookies
```

Verify:
```
> db
milk-n-cookies
```

Common Mistake:
`show dbs`

## CLI: Create a record

### Insert

- use `insert()` to add documents to a collection

### Insert a restaurant

``` json
db.restaurants.insert(
   {
      name: "Cookies Corner",
      "address" : {
         "street" : "1970 2nd St NW",
         "zipcode" : 20001,
      },
      yelp: "http://www.yelp.com/biz/cookies-corner-washington",
});
```

### Verify the insert
```
> show collections
restaurants
system.indexes
```
Note: restaurants

```
> db.restaurants.find()
```

- name
- address
- yelp

What is surprising/unexpected?

- where did restaurants come from?
- `_id`?
- ObjectId
 

## Review `insert`
```
// insert
db.your_collection_name.insert({ data as json })
// find
db.your_collection_name.find()
```

New record:
> If the document passed to the insert() method does not contain the _id field, the mongo shell automatically adds the field to the document and sets the field’s value to a generated ObjectId.

New collection:
> If you attempt to add documents to a collection that does not exist, MongoDB will create the collection for you.

## Dropping a Database

```
use milk-n-cookies
db.dropDatabase()
```

Drops the **current** database.

### Exercise (10 minutes): Add a few more restaurants.

ProTip: I recommend you construct your statements in your editor and copy/paste.  It will help you now & later.

> Prompt: Did anyone insert multiple at one time?

Let's recreate the steps together:
Where are we now?
```
db
```

1. Create DB
2. Use the appropriate DB
3. Insert multiple restaurants

``` mongo
db.restaurants.remove({});
db.restaurants.insert([
  {
      name: "Cookies Corner",
      "address" : {
         "street" : "1970 2nd St NW",
         "zipcode" : 20001,
      },
      yelp: "http://www.yelp.com/biz/cookies-corner-washington"
  },
  { name: "The Blind Dog Cafe", address: { street: "944 Florida Ave",
        zipcode: 20001 }, yelp: "http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-blind-dog-cafe-washington-2?osq=cookies" },
  {name: "Birch & Barley", address: { street: "1337 14th St NW", zipcode: 20005}, yelp: "http://www.yelp.com/biz/birch-and-barley-washington?osq=Restaurants+cookies"},
  {name: "Captain Cookie and the Milk Man", address: { street: "Dupont Circle", zipcode: 20036 }, yelp: "http://www.yelp.com/biz/captain-cookie-and-the-milk-man-washington-5" },
  {name: "J’s Cookies", address: { street: "1700 N Moore St", zipcode: 22209}, yelp: "http://www.yelp.com/biz/js-cookies-arlington" }
])
db.restaurants.count()
```

## [Primary key](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-primary-key)

- A record’s unique immutable identifier.
- RDBMS: usually *id* field, typically an *Integer*
- MongoDB: the *_id* field, usually a *[BSON](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-bson) [ObjectId](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-objectid)*.

## CLI: Find records

Find all:
``` mongo
db.restaurants.find()
```

### Equality Conditions

Key: Value pairs
``` json
{ <field1>: <value1>, <field2>: <value2>, ... }
```

### You do (10 min): Find a single restaurant.  Save that to a variable.

- Pay attention to details
- Compare this to ActiveRecord


``` mongo
var cookies_corner = db.restaurants.find({name: "Cookies Corner"})
```

> Is it a single object?

Note: requires `var`

### We do: Find all in Embedded Document

Look at our restaurant.  We have a document embedded in our restaurant.  

> What is the embedded document?

`address`

To find an embedded document, we use `dot notation`.

Note: 
> Dot notation requires quotes around the whole dotted field name.

### We Do: Find restaurants by Zipcode

> **Prompt**: Using what we know (I understand it's partial information), try to find all restaurants within a zipcode.

Solution:

``` mongo
db.restaurants.find({"address.zipcode": 20001})
```

- [bios Collection](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/bios-example-collection/)


## CLI: Update a record(s)

http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/write-operations-introduction/

```
> db.your_collection.update(
  { criteria },  
  { $set: { assignments }}, 
  { options }
)
```

### You do (10 min): Update all restaurants in 20001 to be in DC.

```
> db.restaurants.update(
  {"address.zipcode": 20001}, 
  { $set: { state: "DC" }}, 
  {multi: true }
)
```
```
WriteResult({ "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 })
```

Verify:
```
> db.restaurants.find()
```

## CLI: Remove records

```
db.restaurants.remove({ conditions })
```

## CLI: Add a nested object

# We already did this!

## Key Advantages

- Usability
- High Performance
- High Availability
- Automatic Scaling
- No SQL :)

### Usability

- Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in many programming languages.
- Schema-less, less need to manage migrations
- Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism.

### High Performance

- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins (reduces I/O).
- Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.

### High Availability

MongoDB’s replication facility, called replica sets, provide:

- automatic failover.
- data redundancy.

replica set:
> is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and increasing data availability.

### Automatic Scaling

- Automatic sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.
- Replica sets can provide eventually-consistent reads for low-latency high throughput deployments.

![mongoose.js](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/KDQZV88GTIaQn6p0GagE)

---

## http://mongoosejs.com

## Why?

> Let's face it, writing MongoDB validation, casting and business logic boilerplate is a drag. 

That's why we wrote Mongoose.

Review example on [mongoosejs.com](http://mongoosejs.com)

``` js
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');

var Cat = mongoose.model('Cat', { name: String });

var kitty = new Cat({ name: 'Zildjian' });
kitty.save(function (err) {
  if (err) // ...
  console.log('meow');
});
```

## Exercise: YUM!  

It's time to play with our restaurants.

Refer to [Getting Started](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html)

### Create a new js "app"

```
mkdir
npm init
npm install --save mongoose
```

### Create a Connection.  Verify it.

```
nodemon index.js
```

``` js
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/milk-n-cookies');

var db = mongoose.connection;
db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
db.once('open', function (callback) {
  console.log("Connection established to: ", db.name)
});
```

### Find restaurants by zip code:

1. Define the Schema
2. Instantiate a model.
3. Find restaurants.
4. Just list names.
5. List names & zip codes (w/o _id)

### Define the Schema

```
var restaurantSchema = mongoose.Schema({
    name: String
})
```

---

**You Do**: Update to match the restaurants in our Db.
- yelp: the url to this restaurant on yelp.com
- address: All we need is street and zipcode.

http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html

```
var restaurantSchema = mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    yelp: String,
    address: {
      street: String,
      zipcode: Number
    }
})
```

- `Restaurant.find({ conditions })`
- `Restaurant.count({ conditions })`

``` js
// List restaurants in zipcode 20001
  var searchZipcode = 20001
  Restaurant.count({"address.zipcode": searchZipcode}, function (err, restaurantCount) {
    if (err) return handleError(err);
    console.log("We have", restaurantCount, "in", searchZipcode)
  })
```
