Congratulations!  You have completed the Instructor Code Challenge.
Now you are qualified to...

   change the persistence to mongoose.

We are introducing a slightly different flow for this homework.  Since it is a continuation of yesterday, we are asking you to start from a particular branch.  Creating a branch from there for your work.

This flow will occur regularly in a development environment.  You will pick up an existing feature branch and move it forward with your contribution.

```
cd path/to/last_nights_homework
git checkout starter_with_mongoose
git checkout -b solution_with_mongoose_YOUR_NAME # i.e. solution_with_mongoose_matt_s
...
mongoose or BUST!
...
git push
```

Note: all of this should be done from *your* fork of https://github.com/ga-dc/instructor_code_challenge.

Once complete, create a pull request from `solution_with_mongoose_YOUR_NAME`

Enjoy!
