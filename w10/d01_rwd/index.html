        <p>This looks exactly like him.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Michael was raised by a pack of hyper-intelligent wolves in the Antarctic tundra.</p>

      <p>One day, he got pretty tired of seal meat and decided to move to Washington, DC, to become a web developer.</p>

      <p>The wolves migrate up to Washington every 4th of July to see the fireworks with him.</p>
