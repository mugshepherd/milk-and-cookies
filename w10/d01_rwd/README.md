# Responsive Web Design

- Create a webpage that incorporates both `@media` queries and `meta` tags to adjust layouts based on screen size
- Distinguish between dimensions expressed as viewport units, pixels, percentages, and ems
- Test a website in various browsers using cross-browser testing tools
- Judge whether or not a product development plan incorporates progressive enhancement
- Write a chart of which CSS and Javascript properties are accepted by which browsers

## Intro

Once upon a time, everyone used desktop computers. Then along came mobile phones. Things that look great on a big desktop screen might look heinous on a tiny mobile screen. This gave birth to the art of responsive web design: making sites look great regardless of what you're using to look at them.

We'll be looking at "red flags" to watch out for, and specific steps to take when creating your sites, to ensure audiences everywhere can see them the way you intended.

By the end of this class, you should be able to...

## Steps to making a responsive website

Three main things to remember:

1. Progressively enhance

2. Validate, validate, validate

3. Test across browsers


- Make a website via progressive enhancement
  - What is progressive enhancement?
  - How would this apply to web browsers?

### 1. Write your HTML
- What tags should you NOT use?
```
<center>
<b>
<i>
<u>
<br /> (In moderation)
<hr /> (In moderation)
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>
<center>
<big>
```
- Validate!
  - validator.w3.org
  - Why is this important?
    - Different tags are supported by different browsers, including FUTURE browsers

#### You do
- Turn to your partner, get 3 sentences, make a website about them

### 2. Normalize your CSS and HTML
- Why is this important?
  - Makes sure you don't have default browser styles messing up everything
  - Example: By default `<body>`has margins in Chrome
- Normalize HTML
  - HTML5 shiv
    - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html5shiv/3.7.2/html5shiv.min.js
    - Adds in `<section>` and stuff for IE9-
- Normalize CSS

  - Hand-rolled (VALIDATE)

```
*
{
	margin:0;
	border:0;
	padding:0;
	border-collapse:collapse;
	border-spacing:0;
	font-weight:inherit;
	font-size:inherit;
	font-style:inherit;
	color:inherit;
	background-color:transparent;
	box-sizing:border-box;
	font-family:inherit
}
*:focus
{
	outline:0
}
```

### 3. Define your themes
- The things you want to be constant across all pages of your site, regardless of what kind of device you're using
- Not doing arrangement/layout yet!
  - Why?
- What might we include?
```
color
background-color
font-family
text-decoration
font-weight
font-size
border-style
border-color
border-radius
NOT border-width
```

- How to organize CSS?
  - Couple options:
    - Order of appearance
    - Tags first, then classes, then IDs
  - Whatever works best for you!
- **VALIDATE!!**

### 4. Define default layout
- Most basic layout, using most basic CSS properties
- Make it work on old browsers
- Relative units
  - `em` vs `px` vs `%`
  - Why use relative units?
- `<wbr />` and `&shy;`
  - Shy is better
- `max-width` and `min-width`
- Margin and padding percentages are for the WIDTH of the containing block

### 5. Define other layouts
- Media queries
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width:500px)" href="whatever.css" />`
    - Note that this still loads everything at the start. If effectively just wraps a media query around it.
  - `@media (max-width:700px){}`
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media
- `vh` vs `vw` vs `rem`
- What's wrong with `:hover`?
  - Smartphones can't really hover
- Giving `<img />` a background image
- `page-break`
