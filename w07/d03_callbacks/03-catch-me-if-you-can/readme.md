# Catch Me If You Can

Using Javascript:

1. Create a blue square that's 100px wide and 100px tall
2. Add it to the div with the class "click-zone"
3. Every second, make it move to a random position in the click-zone
  - hint: use `position:absolute`, `top`, and `left`
4. When the user clicks on the square, alert the user that they have won.
  - Stop the random movement of the square.

## Bonus

Add easy, medium, and hard buttons. Clicking on one of these buttons should change the size of the square
to make it easier or harder to click.

## Double Bonus

Place the square anywhere on the page, but make sure the square stays inside the window.

## Triple Bonus

Make sure the square stays inside the window even if the user resizes their browser.
