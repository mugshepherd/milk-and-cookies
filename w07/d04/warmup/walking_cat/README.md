# DolphinCat!

## Learning Objectives

* Practice using setInterval to repeatedly perform an action
* Use JS to manipulate absolute positioning to 'animate' objects.

## Walk like an egyptian (cat)

Oh no! Snuggles the cat is frozen in the bottom left corner. Help him out by writing
some JavaScript to make him walk across the screen.

Don't let Snuggles walk off the right of the screen! Find a way to reset his
position if he walks too far...

Tips:
* Look at the CSS positioning on the cat. How might this help you move him?
  * Maybe start by writing some JS to just move him a few pixels to the right?
* setInterval might be useful here for doing the same action indefinitely every
  few milliseconds...

## Bonus - Help Snuggles the Cat and Dewey the Dolphin become BFFs!

Give Snuggles special powers, so that he walks up and over, meeting Dewey the Dolphin
near the middle of the screen.

Make sure he's facing the direction that he's walking.

When Snuggles reaches Dewey, have him celebrate by doing a dance!

Tips:
  * You may want to look into css transform properties for rotation...
