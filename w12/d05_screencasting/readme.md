# The Art of Screencasting

Or, how to submit project 4.

## Preparing your enviornment

### Remove or hide desktop icons

- [Camouflage](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camouflage/id445264274?mt=12)
- [Ubuntu Linux](http://askubuntu.com/a/116891)

### Quit irrelevant applications

- Notifications can be incriminating!
- Other applications running are distracting

### Clean up your dock

The less things the viewer has to look at, the more likely
they'll focus on what you're showing.

If this seems like a daunting task, try creating a new user account on your machine.

## Planning your screencast

### Do a dry run first

Decide on the order of what you're going to talk about. Set a timer for 3-5 minutes
and do a dry run.

### Open relevant links, applications, and command prompts

Once you know the order of things you want to talk about, you can use
open tabs, terminals, and applications as a cue for what to do next.

## Record your screencast

The free application Quicktime is included on macs. On Linux, check out [gtk-recordmydesktop](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php)
If you're looking for something with more capabilty, check out:

- [Screenflow $99](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)
- [Camtasia $99](https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html)

These applications record the same quality of video as the free applications. They are most
useful in their editing abilities.

For Quicktime, select File > New Screen Recording

### Make Sure

The audio is recording as well!

## Submit your video

Choose a video hosting service to upload your screencast. I recommend YouTube:

1. Visit youtube.com and log in
2. Set up your channel
3. Upload your video
4. Fill out the description
  - Please include your name and contact email address in the description for prospective employers
5. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdidc5_project4/issues/new?title=video+submission) with a link to your video.
