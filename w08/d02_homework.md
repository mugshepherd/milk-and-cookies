## First...

Complete the steps in the `ajax` branch of the Stock Tracker repo:

https://github.com/ga-dc/stock-tracker/tree/ajax

(Hint: `git pull origin ajax` into a new branch.)

## Then...

Pull down the `solution` branch of the Trillo repo:

https://github.com/ga-dc/trillo/tree/solution

Walk through all of the Javascript and add in comments saying **in plain English** what each portion does.
