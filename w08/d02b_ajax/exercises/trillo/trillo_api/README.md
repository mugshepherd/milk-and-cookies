# Trillo

* As a user, I want to add new cards so I can track my to-do items.
* As a user, I want to see my existing cards when I revisit Trillo, so I can view my to-dos from anywhere.
* As a user, I want to be able to mark cards as completed so I can focus on my remaining items.
* As a user, I want to delete cards, so I can eliminate incriminating evidence.
